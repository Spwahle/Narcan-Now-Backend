##Description of our Service

Narcan Now wants to find the fastest way to get anti-overdose drugs to potential victims–and often times people who can help or locations that could provide the drug are closer than the nearest ambulance.


Users can create accounts which allow them to view/add Narcan locations.
Users can also request aid, in which other nearby will be notified and directed to the fastest possible to route

##Sample Use Cases

Narcan Now’s concept is a simple, easy-to-use mobile app designed to connect potential opioid overdose victims with a crowd-sourced network of naloxone carriers. Narcan Now can easily be tailored for use in rural or urban areas by expanding or contracting the radius within which naloxone carriers are sought. An additional innovative feature of Narcan Now is the optional interface with a breathing monitor to detect when a victim’s breathing rate is dangerously low, a sign of an opioid overdose. Hence, if the victim is alone and unable to call for help, Narcan Now will detect the diminished breathing and alert a naloxone carrier of the potential overdose. Other features of Narcan Now include: only alerting people in one’s support network and allowing naloxone carriers to disable alerts when they are unable to respond. The app also provides instructions on how to correctly diagnose an overdose and administer naloxone and helps contact emergency medical services when help is required.
